<p>At NSIDC, researchers study Arctic sea ice using data from satellites. But those data just provide one view of the ice cover.  Arctic biologists, climate scientists, hunters, and ship captains all use data on sea ice to inform their work. NSIDC data expert Mark Parsons said, “Think about just a simple term like ‘ice edge.’ Different communities define that in different ways.” Researchers who use satellite data define the edge of the sea ice pack as where less than fifteen percent of the surface is covered in ice. Parsons said, “But if you are a ship captain, that’s not going to cut it. You need to know where the ice edge is in terms of risk to your ship.”</p>
<p>How can sea ice data from different disciplines be made accessible and usable by a broader audience? Parsons and a team of researchers from NSIDC and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are working to solve that problem with a new project called the <a href="http://nsidc.org/ssiii">Semantic Sea Ice Interoperability Initiative (SSIII)</a>. “The whole goal in Arctic science is to try to understand the Arctic as a system,” said Parsons. ”So we need data from very diverse sources.” The SSIII aims to bridge the gaps between those different data types, establishing clear definitions of terms and linking them to other terms in a way that computers can understand and communicate.</p>
<div id="attachment_586" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights/files/2012/05/ice_chart.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-586 " src="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights/files/2012/05/ice_chart_small.gif" alt="" width="400" height="310" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This ice chart from the National Ice Center encodes sea ice data in a way that makes sense to ships and boats. The SSIII takes data like these and provides additional information that make the data more understandable to a broad audience. Credit: NSIDC/NIC</p></div>
<p>The SSIII takes vague terms like “ice edge” and encodes all the different definitions, in a way that computers can comprehend them, to create a framework that organizes concepts and their relationships,  called an ontology. The ontology for ice edge would include the ship captain’s definition, the remote sensing definition, as well as any definitions provided by other groups like Inuit hunters, who rely on the ice pack for travel and hunting.</p>
<p><strong>Towards interoperability</strong></p>
<p>Organizing the vocabularies of sea ice into a framework provides a foundation for sharing not just data, but the meaning of the data  “This is a baby step towards the greater vision,” said Parsons. “You have precise meanings that are understood by machines, to enable people to use data from different sources.” While the SSIII focuses on sea ice as a model system, Parsons and his colleagues at NSIDC and Rensselaer are part of a growing community of data experts who are working to make data more accessible and useable, as science becomes increasingly interdisciplinary and data sets become larger and more complicated. The ontologies are available at <a href="http://nsidc.org/ssiii">http://nsidc.org/ssiii</a> and the team welcomes feedback. The project, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, has just completed its first of four years.</p>

<p>Researchers in Boulder and Zurich are gaining ground in compiling the most extensive record of Earth’s constantly changing glaciers. Using data from aerial photographs and maps, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) have added 25,000 more glaciers to World Glacier Inventory (WGI), bringing the total to 132,890. The inventory now describes 85 percent of Earth’s estimated 160,000 glaciers, or 70 percent (470,000 square kilometers) of the total estimated area covered by glaciers and ice caps (680,000 square kilometers).</p>
<p>Glaciers are slowly moving rivers of ice made up of fallen snow that, over the years, compressed into large, thickened ice masses. Some are the size of football fields while others grow to be over a hundred kilometers long. Scientists study glaciers because these are a large source of fresh water and are among the most sensitive indicators of climate change.</p>
<h2>How much ice</h2>
<p>“How many glaciers are there on Earth? That’s a good question, but a very hard one to answer,” said NSIDC glaciologist Bruce Raup. When glaciers grow or retreat over time, they can either merge into a bigger one or get divided into smaller ones. Estimates of the total number of glaciers vary hugely, from 160,000 to 300,000.</p>
<p>“It’s easier and more important to keep track of how many square kilometers are covered by glaciers,” Raup said. “Say a glacier retreats up a valley and its tributaries get separated. Where you once had one glacier, you now have three. But then you also have less ice.”</p>
<p>How much ice a glacier contains or has lost interests scientists the most. Each glacier in the inventory is described by geographic location, area, length, width, elevation, glacier classification and form, orientation, and ablation (how much snow or ice the glacier has lost) and accumulation area. Using these, scientists can derive information on how climate is changing and how much glacial melt is contributing to rising sea levels.</p>
<h2>Ambitious effort</h2>
<p>The inventory has been valuable in helping build other glacier databases. The Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS), a database of glacier outlines from satellite data, draws on and extends information from the inventory and is monitoring changes in 93,000 glaciers. The Randolph Glacier Inventory, in turn, expands on GLIMS to produce a complete map of where all glaciers are on Earth, in preparation for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<p>“The World Glacier Inventory is the oldest of modern glacier inventories,” Raup said. “It’s a global, collaborative effort and is rooted in work that began in the 1890s as an ambitious attempt to measure and classify all perennial ice masses on Earth.” Glaciers recently added to the inventory are located in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Antarctic Islands, South Patagonia, the Central Andes, Iceland, Greenland, and Baffin Island and Yukon in Canada. NSIDC and the WGMS will continue to update and improve the inventory as more data becomes available.</p>

<p>The NASA Operation IceBridge mission ensures continuous scientific observations over Earth’s polar regions during a period of unprecedented change. The mission collects airborne remote sensing measurements to bridge the gap between the NASA Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), which stopped collecting data in 2009, and the upcoming ICESat-2 mission planned for 2016.</p>
<p>ICESat carried the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument, which was unique in its ability to measure the elevation of ice sheets, ice shelves, and glaciers, compared to other satellites that only detect surface extent. These elevation measurements help researchers assess mass changes in the ice, an indicator of climate change as well as of the potential for sea level rise as water is unlocked from glaciers and ice sheets and added to the oceans.</p>
<p>The data produced by IceBridge are just as complex as they are critical. As the data archive and distribution point for IceBridge, NSIDC is addressing the unique challenges of managing data for an extended airborne campaign and getting these data into the hands of researchers studying the polar regions. The recent update of the IceBridge Data Portal at NSIDC is designed to speed that access.</p>
<h2>IceBridge data at NSIDC</h2>
<p>To date, NSIDC has published 47 unique data sets. Many more data sets are expected as annual campaigns wrap up and submit their data. IceBridge mission observations and measurements include coastal Greenland, coastal Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, interior Antarctica, the southeast Alaskan glaciers, and Antarctic and Arctic sea ice.</p>
<p>These data were acquired by 30 separate instruments during 12 flight campaigns, which is one reason that IceBridge data are more complex to manage and access than satellite data. IceBridge combines multiple instruments to map ice surface topography, bedrock topography beneath the ice sheets, grounding line position, ice and snow thickness, and sea ice distribution and freeboard. Data from laser altimeters and radar sounders are paired with gravimeter, magnetometer, digital camera, and other data to provide dynamic, high-value, repeat measurements of rapidly changing portions of land and sea ice.</p>
<p>Because these measurements follow a complex web of flight lines rather than the large, consistent swaths of satellite-borne instruments, researchers need a way to discover what data exist for a study region. NSIDC is building the IceBridge Data Portal to help researchers more quickly locate and access data, using a map-based interface.</p>
<h2>The IceBridge Data Portal </h2>
<p>The IceBridge Data Portal is a Web-based tool for quickly and easily finding flight reports and science data for a selected flight. A map display helps users visualize where the actual flights took place. The interface provides three panels with information and controls to display flight reports, instrument data, and related data sets.</p>
<p>In the Filter panel, users can filter flight reports by temporal coverage using a calendar, and filter flight reports by spatial coverage by drawing a bounding box on the map display. Flight lines appear on the map, showing researchers which flights covered a particular study area. Users can click on a flight line to get more detailed information.</p>
<p>The Data Details panel displays metadata about the selected flight report, and a link to either a text file, or a Portable Document Format (PDF) of the flight report. The text file contains a subset of the content in the PDF. The PDF contains more detailed information logged by the flight manager after the flight.</p>
<p>Users can also click on a flight report in the Choose Data panel, and that flight line will change to yellow on the map display. They can click on the data set link in the Choose Data panel to access the flight data via FTP. They can also access related NSIDC data sets.</p>
<p>In addition, NSIDC is currently preparing to put datasets into permanent archive, where they will have full spatial metadata and more related services. This move will make the data accessible via the NASA Reverb data interface and the NSIDC Data Pool drill down interface, in addition to direct FTP download. Future portal releases will include more sophisticated search and visualization functions necessary to fully exploit the data. These steps are part of the long-term plan to increase visibility and access for IceBridge data.</p>

<p>When it comes to climate change in the Arctic, melting sea ice and warming oceans often get the most attention. Yet in the atmosphere, another watery component is changing as well: water vapor. As sea ice extent and duration decrease and air temperatures rise, the increasingly open Arctic Ocean is subject to even more evaporation, pumping more water vapor into the atmosphere, making it more humid. In addition, warmer air is capable of holding more water, so increasing humidity over the Arctic may be yet another signal that air temperatures in the region are rising, producing yet another feedback mechanism throwing the Arctic climate off-kilter.</p>
<h2>Looking backward to look forward</h2>
<p>To understand how an increase in water vapor might play into the changing Arctic climate, NSIDC scientists Mark Serreze, Julienne Stroeve, and Andrew Barrett looked at data from radiosondes, instruments attached to weather balloons that are released into the atmosphere to measure things like temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. The readings, collected between 1979 and 2010, provided evidence that not only were seasonal air temperatures increasing, but so was the humidity, or the amount of water vapor in the air.</p>
<p>Meteorological data from the radiosondes could only provide part of the picture. To place the findings in the larger context of Arctic climate, the team combined the radiosonde data with six different atmospheric reanalyses.<br />
Reanalyses assimilate historic climate data, such as from radiosondes or satellites, in a consistent fashion. This consistency minimizes anomalies and differences caused by things like changes in data collection methods, sensors, or parameters that may have occurred over time, making it easier to accurately compare data from different sources. Poring through several different reanalyses permitted the scientists to better identify long-term trends over the entire Arctic region.</p>
<h2>Feeding the feedbacks</h2>
<div id="attachment_145" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2012/03/January_2012_reanalyses_large.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-145  " src="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2012/03/January_2012_reanalyses.jpg" alt="Data image showing a model of water vapor over the Arctic during the month of September" width="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The NASA-based Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research And Applications (MERRA) reanalysis model is one of the reanalysis projects that NSIDC scientists relied on to observe increased humidity over the Arctic. The data revealed a spike in atmospheric water vapor over portions of the Arctic that coincide with decreasing sea ice, particularly over the North Atlantic east of Greenland and in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas north and west of Alaska. —Credit: NSIDC</p></div>
<p>Between the radiosonde data and the reanalysis efforts, Serreze and his colleagues found consistent matches that often coincided with other signals of climate change. For instance, an increase in water vapor over the North Atlantic corresponded with regions of higher sea surface temperatures, particularly over the North Atlantic. Similarly, a rise in water vapor also occurred over the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, areas where annual end-of-season sea ice loss during August and September has been most dramatic.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is a feedback mechanism. Decreased sea ice extent is leaving larger areas of open water, leading to more evaporation into a slightly warmer atmosphere. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, higher humidity may cause further warming in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Of course, climate scientists expect some degree of seasonal and interannual variations in Arctic climate, but the amount of change they have observed is more noticeable and more rapid than elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. And the change is still underway: how this increase in humidity affects Arctic climate remains to be seen. Will more water vapor lead to increased rain or snowfall among Earth&#8217;s higher latitudes? Or is the Arctic destined to remain a more humid, and perhaps more temperate, environment?</p>

What will be the legacies of the 2007-2008 IPY?</p>
<p>Among those legacies are lessons on collaborative data management and data sharing for today&#8217;s highly interdisciplinary, data-intensive science. Whether data are images captured by satellites in space or the deep knowledge of indigenous hunters on the ground, IPY highlighted the need for changes in data management, and the potential to in turn support scientific progress. As a result, practices have evolved at data centers like NSIDC, and IPY continues to shape how the scientific community thinks about and plans for data management.</p>
<h2>Open data and data policy</h2>
<p>During a time of rapid polar change, IPY called for open data release on the &#8220;shortest feasible timescale,&#8221; to support the interdisciplinary collaboration that can lead to richer insights during an IPY. This data policy pushed the bounds of established practice, while recognizing ethical restrictions of data sharing, such as concerns about human subjects and fair attribution for data creators.</p>
<p>To maximize their value and reuse, public data should be made freely available in the public domain. This is a major focus of the <a href="http://www.polarcommons.org">Polar Information Commons</a>, an ICSU project following on from IPY to establish an improved framework for polar data sharing and preservation. A central tenant of the PIC is that data should be as unrestricted as possible, but scientists need to establish norms of behavior that ensure proper, informed, and equitable data use.</p>
<p>From these concepts of timely data release and ethical data sharing, many nations imposed new, open-data conditions as part of IPY project funding requirements. The U.S. Arctic Observing Network (AON) was a leading example, requiring annual data deposit in a collaborative archive at NSIDC and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.</p>
<p>IPY also encouraged fair attribution for data creators by promoting formal data citation and providing data citation guidelines. NSIDC has continued this effort, and an evolved version of the IPY Guidelines has been adopted by both the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP).</p>
<p>Many IPY data in some countries and disciplines remain unavailable, and much in the culture of science resists open and timely access. Nevertheless, IPY has fundamentally changed the conversation in polar science. No longer is it a question of whether to share data but rather when and how. Furthermore, it is clear that funding agencies have the ability to steer that conversation.</p>
<h2>Developing infrastructure</h2>
<p>One of the greatest lessons from IPY is that data management must be funded and planned in advance. Important developments in polar data infrastructure have occurred, but we are still playing catch up. Significant differences remain between Arctic and Antarctic data management, at both national and international levels. While the situation has improved, new polar research programs are still designed today without considering data sharing and archiving needs and their support. As a result, some of these data are at risk for becoming inaccessible, or lost to future researchers.</p>
<p>We also learned that different disciplines have different attitudes and norms of behavior around data sharing. They also have highly variable data infrastructures. Much more flexible and collaborative systems are needed, and science communities also need to recognize that the groundwork for sharing data between systems is laid at the time of data collection. It starts with using consistent protocols and measurement techniques within disciplines, which can, in turn, drive data formats. Designated &#8220;data coordinators&#8221; at the project and national level greatly facilitate this process.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, IPY led to the creation of many new national and discipline-based data centers. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) funded a new system to handle all the data from NSF-funded Arctic investigators, as a collaborative effort between NSIDC and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Increasingly, data centers such as these are networked and share metadata and data through automated systems.</p>
<p>While IPY visions of integrated data systems are still a long ways off, some of the building blocks are coming into place. Furthermore, there is greater emphasis on data management in disciplines where it was previously lacking, such as Arctic biodiversity and local and traditional knowledge.</p>
<h2>New collaborations</h2>
<p>Perhaps the greatest outcome of IPY was the increase in international and interdisciplinary collaboration around data management. Repeatedly, data managers found how a pragmatic, flexible, and especially a collaborative approach can encourage change in science that enhances data flow and usefulness. NSIDC has increased its collaboration with data creators and data centers around the world as a result of IPY, helping to create more robust and useful data and to identify and spread best practices. We look forward to maintaining these collaborations with our new friends to ensure IPY data survive as the lasting legacy of IPY.</p>

<p>The rising interest in Arctic sea ice is the inverse of its decline: less ice equates to more demand for reliable data on sea ice conditions. But with decades of data from multiple satellite sensors and multiple research groups, where do researchers turn for the most reliable long-term view? In answer, NSIDC has produced a Climate Data Record for sea ice concentration, an important indicator of sea ice health and Arctic climate.</p>
<h2>The demand for data</h2>
<p>The National Research Council (NRC) defines a Climate Data Record (CDR) as a time series of measurements of sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to determine climate variability and change. Because of the strong decline in Arctic sea ice, a signal of climate warming, some of NSIDC’s most used products are sea ice records from passive microwave remote sensing instruments on U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. These products provide ice concentration and extent information since late 1978, based on two algorithms developed by scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Each algorithm utilizes scientific expertise to manually pull out spurious areas of ice, and the resulting data products have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051.html">NASA Team data product</a> is more accurate where surface temperatures are very cold; the <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0079.html">Bootstrap data product</a> does a better job where ice is melting.</p>
<p>Like many climate data sets, the sea ice concentration products were developed and processed by individual researchers or research groups for use within the scientific community studying sea ice. These expert users knew how to appropriately use the data, and understood the limitations of the data. However, as interest in sea ice data (and climate data in general) has increased, there is a much broader community of users: researchers in other areas of climate, modelers, biologists, ecologists, sociologists, civilian and military government planners, educators, students, journalists, bloggers, and the general public. These users are not familiar with the science behind the data or the subtleties of different data sets. As a result, they may not understand the limitations of the data, and can easily misuse the data.</p>
<h2>Setting the record straight</h2>
<div id="attachment_309" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2011/11/nov_11_fig2.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-309    " src="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2011/11/nov_11_fig2_sm.png" alt="data processing flow" width="350" height="238" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This diagram shows the flow of data processing for the Climate Data Record for sea ice concentration data.</p></div>
<p>When NSIDC set out to produce a CDR for sea ice concentration under NOAA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdr/">CDR program</a>, the intent was to blend the current NASA GSFC products into the combined CDR. As NSIDC examined the blended product, it became clear that it would not meet NOAA&#8217;s requirement to be transparent and reproducible. So NSIDC created a new data product by reprocessing the original satellite data with both the NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms, adding several features to meet CDR criteria. First, the processing is fully automated and documented, with processing code available from the NOAA CDR program. Second, the data are provided in a self-describing file format (NetCDF4) that contains complete Climate and Forecasting (CF1.5) metadata. Finally, the data include fields that indicate data quality or uncertainty for each concentration measurement.</p>
<p>The new sea ice CDR was recently made available to users. The CDR provides a consistent, daily time series of sea ice concentrations from 09 July 1987 through 31 December 2007. Data are in the same polar projection and grid size as the previous NSIDC and NASA data sets. The original NASA data sets are also provided for reference. Additional years of data will be released as processing permits.</p>
<p>Access the <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/g02202.html">NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration</a>.</p>
<p>This work was supported by the NOAA Climate Data Record program, grant #NA08OAR4320914. The <a href="/daac/">NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at NSIDC</a> provided input data sets to the CDR effort under NASA contract NNG08HZ07C.</p>

<p>Snow and ice by definition need to stay cold, and so do scientific data about snow and ice. While computer room air conditioning is not the kind of cold that NSIDC normally specializes in, NSIDC has figured out how to keep its computers and data cool with a lower carbon footprint. The NSIDC Green Data Center, a first-of-its-kind system, has cut the energy required to cool its data center by more than 90%, and stands as a model for others to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<h2>The impossible dream</h2>
<p>At NSIDC, a roomful of computers and storage devices serve up its data archive containing more than 500 terabytes of data on the world&#8217;s frozen regions, to researchers around the globe. Keeping these machines cool so that they can operate safely used to consume more than 300,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to cool 34 average U.S. homes. &#8220;There was a certain irony that here we are working on climate research and our data center was consuming an awful lot of power,&#8221; NSIDC technical services manager David Gallaher said.</p>
<p>He had a vision of massively cutting the energy used to run the data center on a combination of advanced cooling and solar arrays. Many people told him it could not be done, but he found enthusiastic partners at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and at Colorado companies Coolerado Corporation and RMH Group. Together they designed a new data center, using energy-sipping indirect evaporative units that cool by blowing air over water. The NSIDC team was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation under its Academic Research Infrastructure Program to renovate the computing facility.</p>
<p>The design takes advantage of Boulder, Colorado&#8217;s dry climate. Evaporative cooling works best in low-humidity conditions; plus, during cool weather, the new system shuts off the cooling units, and draws in the cool outside air and filters it.  The Coolerados function as chillers in the summer and humidifiers in the winter. Humidity and temperature are controlled within a few percent. The system has smart software controls to automatically swing between the evaporative coolers and outdoor air.</p>
<h2>Powered by the sun</h2>
<p>Soon, the dream of a solar-powered data center will be a reality. In late 2011, 720 solar panels will be mounted on NSIDC&#8217;s roof. The panels will generate enough energy to cool the data center, operate the computers, charge backup batteries, and feed energy back to the grid, when the sun is shining. Since Boulder averages more than 330 days of sunshine per year, Gallaher expects the solar array to provide about 70% of the retrofitted computing facility&#8217;s power needs.</p>
<p>Gallaher and NSIDC want to share what they learned with others, in hopes of helping to reduce the energy demands and carbon emissions of data and computing centers around the U.S. According to the EPA, data centers in the U.S. consume as much energy as 5.8 million average U.S. households, which is similar to the amount of electricity used by the entire U.S transportation manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology works, and it shows that others can do this too,&#8221; Gallaher said.</p>
<p>Gallaher and his team received the Colorado Governor&#8217;s Award for High-Impact Research for the project. See the related <a href="/news/press/20111101_green_data_center.html">press release</a>.</p>

<p>On September 21 to 23, more than 90 Antarctic scientists, data experts, writers, and students gathered at Sylvan Dale Ranch, nestled in the rolling plains near Loveland, Colorado. This three-day retreat brought diverse research disciplines from around the world to focus on rapid changes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and related areas of other ice caps.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the ice in Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests on bedrock below sea level. In the 1970s, theoretical research suggested this made it vulnerable to a rapid collapse, potentially as quickly as two centuries, that could add several meters to sea level. NASA researcher Bob Bindschadler said, “This research suggested that ice sheets were not stable if they sat on a bed below sea level.” Once the ice sheet began to retreat, water would flow under it, lifting the ice and floating it off its resting place.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 349px"><a href="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2012/03/Sept2011_TedWAIS.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-194" src="http://nsidc.org/monthlyhighlights2/files/2012/03/Ted_RideWAIS_thumb.jpg" alt="ted scambos on a horse" width="339" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The WAIS Workshop is organized as a retreat, getting researchers together in a remote, quiet setting, where they can focus on talking to each other about science. This year the attendees also had the chance to get out and explore the 5,000 acres of Sylvan Dale Ranch, either on foot or horse. Credit: Ted Scambos, NSIDC</p></div>
<p>Research on the WAIS started off with glacier studies, but researchers soon realized that there were more factors involved. “As the science evolved, we realized it wasn’t just a glaciological problem. There were additional aspects of the science that involved meteorology and oceanography and ice coring subglacial geology,” said Bindschadler. The researchers needed to measure and monitor such things as whether the ice sheet was gaining or losing mass, whether glaciers were speeding up their flows, and how much these changes were adding to sea level.</p>
<h2>An interdisciplinary community</h2>
<p>Each year, scientists meet at the workshop to share the latest WAIS research, and mull over difficult questions like how the valleys and lakes underneath the ice sheet affect how it moves, or what happens to glaciers when the ice shelves in front of them collapse. NSIDC Lead Scientist Ted Scambos organized the workshop this year along with NSIDC and CIRES staff. He said, “The WAIS meeting is the key meeting of the year for ice sheet dynamics, remote sensing, and the net growth or shrinkage—mass balance—of the WAIS and other major ice sheets.”</p>
<p>This year, researchers presented new data that helps better quantify just how much ice is trapped in the giant ice sheet, how fast it is moving, and where it is going. Researchers from UC Irvine presented a new, virtually complete map of ice velocity across Antarctica, showing where the ice is flowing fastest. Scientists also discussed how to best harness data from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite to measure the mass of the ice sheet, and determine how that data might fit together with new data from the European Cryosat mission and the upcoming Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite–2 (ICESat–2). New radar studies presented detailed maps of the lakes and rivers that flow beneath the ice sheet.</p>
<p>Christine LeDoux, a researcher at Portland State University, attended the workshop for the first time this year. She said, “The length of the meeting and social opportunities made it possible to talk with many people, working on different parts of problems similar to mine, or interesting in different ways.” LeDoux presented details of the history of ice flow and fracturing on the Ross Ice Shelf using MODIS mosaic images.</p>
<p>As observations of West Antarctica improve, the scientists are realizing that it’s more important than ever to continue the meeting. Bindschadler said, “We have been astonished at how rapidly changes can occur. We are no longer talking about hypothetical dynamics of the ice sheets, but we are perhaps witnessing the early stages of this.”</p>

<p>As Arctic sea ice declines towards its lowest extent for the year, people around the world are watching. Will the ice extent break another record this year? What would it mean if it does break a record? If it doesn&#8217;t break a record, does that mean the sea ice is recovering?</p>
<p>Many people will find their answers to these questions on the NSIDC <a href="/arcticseaicenews/">Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis</a> Web site. Interested readers can follow the ups and downs of sea ice extent in near-real time, checking back daily for data updates. Once or twice a month, NSIDC scientists weigh in with their analysis of current conditions and highlights of related data and research, including from the broader science community. Scientists work with NSIDC communications staff to write clear, concise articles. The result is a unique source of scientific information that provides valuable real-time input for researchers around the world studying sea ice and the Arctic environment, but written in a way that is accessible to everyone, including the general public.</p>
<h2>Making data available and understandable</h2>
<p><em>Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis</em> grew out of an effort to share information with journalists, during the record-low sea ice levels in 2007. But the site drew millions of visits, reaching a far broader audience than originally intended. Regular readers now include scientists, journalists, teachers, students, and the interested public. These readers have different views about science and the changing climate, but all are interested in sea ice data.</p>
<p>NSIDC primarily functions as a data center, archiving scientific data and making it available to scientists. But more and more, people are calling for transparency and openness in scientific data.  <em>Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis</em> shows one way to do that. Making data available is of little use unless people can understand where it comes from and what it means.</p>
<p><em>Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis </em>is partially funded by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.</p>
